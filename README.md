An implementation of Conway's Game of Life [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life].

I wanted to do an implementation that did not use the standard array for the board so that I would not be limited by the constrains that implies. In theory we have an space that in only limited by the max size of integer numbers in Python, the ammount of memory that we have to store the currently alive cells and the amount of time it takes to process the next generation.
